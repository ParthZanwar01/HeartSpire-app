## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option A: Test with Your Own Photos (FASTEST!)

```bash
# 1. Take 5 photos of vitamin bottles (supplement facts panel)
# 2. Transfer to computer
# 3. Test immediately:

cd python-free-implementation
python ocr_approach.py ~/Pictures/vitamin1.jpg

# Or use LLaVA for better accuracy:
# Install: brew install ollama && ollama pull llava
python llava_approach.py ~/Pictures/vitamin1.jpg
```

### Option B: Download Real Images

```bash
cd python-free-implementation

# Download real vitamin images
python download_more_vitamins.py

# Test them
python quick_test_real_images.py
```

2. **Your own photos** = best training data (perfectly matches use case)
3. **User corrections** = gold for training
4. **Supplement facts panels** work better than front labels
5. **Image quality** matters more than quantity

### Accuracy Roadmap:

```
Week 1: Test with own photos          → 80-85% accuracy
Week 2: Download 50 NIH images        → 85-88% accuracy
Month 1: Collect 100 user corrections → 88-92% accuracy
Month 2: Fine-tune on your data       → 92-97% accuracy
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Start Simple**: Test with your own photos first
2. **Quality > Quantity**: 10 good images > 100 bad ones
3. **Use Free Tools**: LLaVA is 95% as good as paid options
4. **Collect User Data**: Best training data comes from your users
5. **Iterate Fast**: Test → Learn → Improve → Repeat

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Don't use front label images (no ingredients!)  
❌ Don't skip image quality checks  
❌ Don't train on synthetic/fake data  
❌ Don't pay for OpenAI until you max out free options  
❌ Don't ignore user corrections (they're gold!)
